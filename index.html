      <p>
        How many years have passed? <br>
I followed orders without ever grasping the full scope of my mission, living as one of that time, in the Blue Era. <br><br>
What exactly was my mission? <br>
I cried myself hoarse after losing a friend on the battlefield. <br>
There were times when I laughed heartily with my companions.<br> 
There were days I was tormented by loneliness, and times I felt my life was in danger. But now, everything is merely a hazy afterimage.<br>
It doesn't matter anymore. <br><br>
The " Crimson Era " I am about to return to, the " Blue Era." that fades in the distance.<br> 
Do they truly exist? <br>
Am I truly alive? <br>
Even that much is uncertain now. <br><br>
Perhaps the "Mission Complete" notification that arrived so suddenly, instantly closed off my entire being. <br><br>
And yet, strangely enough, a scene from an ordinary day sometimes vividly comes back to me.<br><br>
A memory that leaked out of the sealed space...<br> 
The conversation with that " Children of the Dandelion Fluff " is one of them.<br>

       “Still your favorite seat?"<br><br>
Nankai-kun asked as we walked toward the counter by the wide glass window.<br><br>
“Yeah."<br>
“Wouldn’t it be nice to sit face to face for once— look each other in the eye while we talk?"<br><br>
No sooner had he taken his seat than he leaned in and stared straight into my eyes.<br><br>
“F-For once...? This is only the second time, isn’t it?  Anyway, I think coffee tastes better when you look out at the scenery, not my face.”<br><br>
I instinctively leaned back.<br><br>
“Ouch. So what you're saying is, you don’t wanna look at me."<br><br>
How could he be so forward like this?<br>
—And yet, strangely, I didn’t feel uncomfortable.<br>
It was almost like... talking to an old friend.<br>
Different majors. Different clubs.<br>
Our rooms just happened to be next door.<br>
We said hello now and then, but hardly ever talked.<br>
Still, somehow, he stepped into my space without hesitation— as if he belonged there.<br>
Even the first time we came here, he popped up from behind and said:<br>
"You're a fast walker. I'm wiped out from lab. Coffee?"<br>
There was a small pause, but I’d already said “sure” before I realized it.<br>
Just like now.<br><br>
“It's not that. I'm just bad at it. I never know where to look when the conversation lags... and I don’t really like being looked at, either..."<br><br>
I ended up speaking my mind.<br><br>
“Huh. So you think about stuff like that. Didn’t expect you to be so shy."<br>
“Guess so..."<br><br>
Great. I was completely caught in his rhythm.<br>
Why did it always end up like this?<br>
And yet, somewhere inside, I found myself wishing this conversation would go on forever.<br>
I wanted to drop everything and just enjoy this silly, aimless talk.<br>
The quiet clink of our cups touched the air like music.<br><br>
“I like the blend here. It’s bright, kind of citrusy. Refreshing."<br><br>
I nodded softly.<br>
While searching for words, I stared at the steam rising from my cup.<br>
Outside the window, the trees on the street swayed gently.<br><br>
“What's that smell called again? The one right when the rain starts.”<br><br>
He asked suddenly.<br><br>
“Oh—petrichor?”<br> 
“Yes! That's it. Do you smell something kind of similar?”<br><br>
I turned to him, a little surprised.<br>
I thought he was joking, but his face was serious.<br><br>
“Really...? I’m not sure.”<br>
“Hmm... it’s just a feeling, I guess. Weird, right?”<br>
“No... it's not weird. Noticing a scent like that— it’s kind of lovely."<br><br>
Ordinarily, I would never respond to something so... airy.<br>
But right now, I didn’t want to brush it off.<br>
A breeze stirred the steam sideways.<br>
The air softened, as if dressed in light— like dandelion fluff drifting across it.<br>
...Was this really just coincidence?<br>
Did Nankai-kun... actually sense that scent?<br>
No. That couldn’t be.<br>
It must’ve been someone’s perfume wafting past him.<br>
Unless he was from the “Crimson Era,” there’s no way he could notice that scent.<br>
Still, somewhere inside me, a ripple stirred.<br><br>
...Could it be?<br><br>
But no— <br>
I hadn’t received any sign. <br>
No trace. No signal. No resonance.<br> 
My hand trembled slightly as I lifted the cup again.<br>
I glanced again at the side of his face.<br><br>
“Your birthday’s coming up, right?"<br>
“Whose?"<br>
“Yours, Hanazono-san."<br>
“How do you know that?"<br><br>
Was he testing me?<br><br>
“Didn’t you all get into that horoscope craze in the cafeteria the other day?"<br><br>
Oh... right.<br><br>
“Haha, everyone’s into that stuff lately. Do you think it’s accurate?"<br>
“Nope."<br>
“Thought so."<br>
“What would you like for your birthday?"<br>
“A gift? You’re getting me something?"<br>
“Nothing expensive, okay? I'm a broke student— student loan pay my tuition, and part-time jobs cover food. I’m sure you can imagine the lifestyle."<br>
“Yeah, I get it. I’m in the same boat. So... honestly, I’m not really into expensive things. I don’t want anything... tangible."<br>
“Why not?"<br>
“They're just a hassle to manage. I might lose it, or break it. And sometimes I forget who gave me what."<br>
“I see... yeah, you're definitely not ordinary."<br><br>
Not ordinary... why would he say that?<br><br>
“Really?"<br>
“But that's what I like about you."<br>
“...Thanks, I guess. But why is being 'not ordinary' a good thing?"<br>
“Because you’re not boring."<br>
“Hmm..."<br><br>
As we talked, I kept second-guessing my words.<br>
Was he being serious?<br>
Or was he probing, watching my reactions?<br>
Or maybe... maybe he didn’t know anything at all,<br>
and this was just his natural self.<br>
His timing left room for both possibilities.<br>
And his eyes met mine steady and unguarded.<br>
I smiled vaguely.<br><br>
“Do you have a boyfriend?"<br>
“No."<br>
“Good. So how long’s it been since your last one?"<br><br>
What is with these nonstop questions?<br>
Before I knew it, I blurted out, “A hundred twenty years.”<br><br>
“What?"<br>
“Wait, no. That’s not what I meant. I was bluffing."<br>
“Wow, bluffing with a hundred twenty? You an alien or something?"<br>
“No, I just... misspoke. Tried to act cool. Truth is, I’ve... never had one."<br>
“What? Seriously? I can’t believe that."<br>
“I’m just... bad at this stuff."<br>
“Bad at what?"<br>
“I guess... guys?"<br>
“Wait, are you saying—"<br>
“No, not that. It’s more like... I have trouble understanding what people are thinking."<br>
“Yep. Definitely an alien."<br><br>
Oh no... I need to change the flow of this—<br><br>
" M-maybe the way I think... is a little alien too."<br>

        A trail of water stretched straight ahead—<br>
        like a promise left quietly<br>
        by a nameless life upon this world.<br>

       <p>“Hmm. I don’t think you need to overthink it so much."<br>
“I know... but it’s not that easy."<br>
“So, tell me what kind of 'intangible present' can a human give to an alien?"<br>
“Well then… Hey, Nankai-kun, if someone kissed you, would you be happy no matter who it was?"<br>
“Huh? Of course not. you know."<br>
“Exactly."<br>
“Naturally."<br>
“Then… give me the right to kiss you."<br>
“Whoa! Sure, of course. Even if it’s not your birthday yet, you can have it, right now."<br>
“Thanks. I’ll keep it safe."<br>
“Wait, you’re not going to use it? You can, you know. Right away."<br>
“giggle”<br><br>
I’m not very good with this kind of thing...<br>
And yet, somehow, his words left a gentle warmth in my chest.<br><br>
“Hey, don’t look at me like that."<br>
“Why not? You were the one who wanted us to sit face to face, right?"<br>
“This is different. That look—you’re plotting something."<br>
“You know, I can see things other people can’t."<br>
“Whoa—alien alert! So? What exactly do you see?"<br>
“You’ve definitely seen it too, haven’t you, Nankai-kun? The water’s trace left behind by a snail. Depending on the light, you might see it, or not. Sometimes it feels beautiful… sometimes it just feels kind of gross.”<br>
“Hmm..." <br>
“You’re kind of popular, right?"<br> 
“Huh? Where did that come from? Well, I mean... maybe a little..."<br> 
“So, you won’t deny it. I knew it... Your face is all shiny— like it's glowing with kiss marks that only I can see. They look just like... the water trails snails leave behind."<br>
“Pfft! That’s not true! I haven’t been kissed that much!" <br>
“Isn’t it weird? To kiss someone after a snail passed through?"<br>
“Stop! That’s so mean!"<br><br> 
His mock-offended face was kind of cute.<br>
I couldn’t help laughing.<br> 
But part of me wondered... was he just playing around?<br> 
Or maybe he never learned to notice the marks?<br><br>
“That’s why... I’m not using it now."<br>
“Oh, I get it. You can’t with people around. So shy."<br>
“No... that’s not it..."<br><br>
I started to explain, but Nankai-kun suddenly got serious.<br><br>
“Hey, Hanazono-san, do you remember the first time we talked?"<br> 
“Sure. You came up behind me and said, 'You walk fast.'"<br>
“Nope! That wasn’t it. Man, I’m disappointed."<br> <br>
He sighed.<br><br> 
“It was at last year’s science club presentation. Don’t you remember? You shouted, 'Excuse me! Please hold the elevator!' as I was stepping in." <br>
“What...?" <br>
“Oh, never mind. When I turned around, you were there— smiling, holding a stack of papers. And behind you... I saw something. I thought at that moment it was just the path you’d taken— it looked like this shimmering ribbon. And now I wonder... was that the 'water's trace' you mentioned earlier?"<br><br>
Nankai-kun... could that really be? <br>
You carry the essence of the Crimson Era... but you don’t know it. <br>
No records, no traces, no signs.<br> 
So how? <br>
How did you end up here, in this Blue Era?<br><br>
“Whoa, what’s with that face? You look like an alien who just saw a ghost."<br>
“Rude. This is just my face, okay? ...But, sorry— I remember now." <br>
“Yeah, it's fine. I tried talking to you a few times after that, but it was like I’d turned invisible. So I thought, fine— I'll just call out from behind. And when I asked you for coffee, you said yes right away, so I figured... maybe you actually remembered me. But then..."<br> 
"I'm really sorry! I'm kind of awkward like that. Sometimes I just get so into a conversation that I don't even notice what's around me..."<br><br>
I have to leave soon— before the resonance grows stronger.<br><br>
“Got it. About that 'right' I gave you... Even if not now, promise me you’ll use it someday." <br>
“You know, there’s this guy, Eckhart Tolle. He said,<br>
'If someone truly sees tomorrow, build a monument.'<br> 
Because tomorrow doesn’t exist. When it comes, it’s just now. So when I said 'not now,' that’s what I meant."<br>
“Oh come on. Don’t give me that weird talk. It makes no sense. Why even ask for a gift like that?"<br> 
“Hey, take it easy."<br> 
“You got me all excited, and now you're not using it?"<br> 
“You were excited? Thanks. But you know… wasn’t that gift supposed to make me happy? You being the one who’s excited—that’s a bit odd."<br>
“Well... I guess so."<br> 
“Then I’ll accept it. Gratefully.”<br>
“But why? Why ask for something you don’t even plan to use?"<br> 
“Hmm… it’s hard to put into words. Maybe it’s like life insurance. You know, it only pays out when you’re gone.<br>
It’s not like I want to cash it in or anything… I guess it’s more about peace of mind."<br>
“...I still don’t get it."<br> 
“Just knowing someone who sees me as special... That’s enough. Whether we actually kiss or not doesn’t matter. It’s the feeling behind it. Something pure."<br>
“...Love?"<br>
"What is love?" <br>
“Oh no, here we go again."<br> 
“I’ve been really into AI lately. There was this game where we made a story, one sentence at a time. At the end, the AI wrote:<br> 
'Love never truly disappears. It only evolves into a new stage.'<br>
 I thought, wow, It was amazing.<br> 
But then I wondered... what is love, really?<br> 
And the more I thought about it, the less I understood why it felt amazing."<br>
“You’re less of an alien and more of a Zen master. Can’t you just be… normal?"<br> 
“Didn’t you say you liked that I wasn’t normal?"<br> 
“I did… but now I think I’d prefer normal."<br>
“This 'right'... It’s something I only want from someone special."<br> 
“Am I... someone special?"<br>
“...Yes. It’s a gift that only special people give, and it only makes you happy when it comes from someone special. Just holding it in my heart brings me joy.<br>
         That’s why… I don’t want to use it. Isn’t that... normal?"<br>
“Normal people show it off. Or use it happily."<br>
“Wouldn’t letting the recipient do what they want with it be the normal thing?"<br>
“Fine, fine. I give up— you win, Hanazono-san."<br>
“Then I’ll keep it safely tucked away like a precious treasure in the vault of my heart."<br>
"Yeees, but you know, Hanazono-san,<br>
Even if you don’t understand how a smartphone works,
you still learn to use it naturally, right?<br>
Love is the same.<br>
You don’t have to overthink it.<br>
Even without understanding, it grows—quietly, on its own."<br><br>
Wha… wait, Nankai-kun, that’s…<br>
the old legend about the Children of the Dandelion Fluff.<br><br>
‘Love cannot be understood by those of the Blue Era,
and yet, love grows.’<br><br>
Could it be…<br>
you’re one of them?<br>

    <h3>Mission Appendix:<br>
      The Legend of the Children of the Dandelion Fluff</h3>
    <p>
      It is eternally impossible for those living in the Blue Era to fully understand “love.”<br>
And yet, love will grow.<br>
Upon receiving this report,<br>
to preserve the barrier around the Crimson Domain,<br>
pure-hearted children bearing the seeds of love were dispatched.<br>
These are the Children of the Dandelion Fluff.<br>
Most of them drifted through the gaps between eras and vanished without a trace.<br> 
Some may have reached the Blue Domain—<br>
but because of their purity,<br>
no sign, no trace, no hint of them was ever confirmed.<br>
If you recognize a Child of the Dandelion Fluff,<br>
you must retreat at once.<br>
Until the dandelion takes root, blooms, and bears fruit,<br>
you must never make contact.<br>
If the waves between you resonate and amplify,<br>
it may bring about the threat of annihilation.<br>

      <p>“Wow...So love can grow, even if you don't understand it."<br>
“That’s right. …May I ask you out again sometime?"<br><br>
Of course you can.<br>
I want to say “Anytime is fine.”<br>
But I can’t.<br>
I just… can’t.<br><br>
I never truly believed the Children of the Dandelion Fluff existed.<br>
And yet… it’s him?<br>
Nankai-kun?<br>
That’s... too cruel.<br>
What should I do?<br><br>
“...Yeah. But it might be years from now."<br><br>
The words left a faint, bitter taste deep in my throat.<br><br> 
“What? Why?"<br><br>
I can’t tell him... because if I spoke the truth... even the air might tremble.<br><br>
“I'm letting go of the job offer. I’ve decided to travel."<br> 
“What?! That’s so sudden!"<br><br>
...Yeah. I decided just now.<br>
As I tried to steady the tremor in my heart.<br>
What else could I do?<br>
Now that I knew.<br>
If only... if only I had realized sooner.<br>
Maybe...<br>
No. That’s not it.<br>
This is a mission...<br>
We were sent to this Blue Era<br>
to preserve the balance of all eras.<br><br>
“...Not really. I’d planned this a long time ago."<br><br>
I steadied my breath and spoke slowly<br><br>
“I see..."<br>
“I wanted to see the world a little before I’m locked into a job. Been saving up bit by bit."<br>
“So, just my unluck... I finally meet you, and you're all set to leave.”<br>
“Guess it's lucky for you, huh?”<br>
“…Nah.”<br><br>
Please don’t say anything more, Nankai-kun.<br><br>
“Hey, want to head out? Let’s take a detour through the park. The plum blossoms are blooming."<br><br>
Nankai-kun nodded silently.<br><br>
“A farewell among the plum trees... End of Act One.<br>
Act Two begins... with a phone call from you one morning.<br>
Let’s go with that."<br>
“Okay. Even if there’s someone new beside you by then,
I won’t mind."<br>
“Ah—wait. That might be a problem."<br><br>
We laughed lightly, but something was missing.<br>
A silent void seemed to open, swallowing the world into its stillness.<br>
